I'm a performance-minded software engineer with a background in pre-sales, web performance and data visualisation.

I work at Akamai, building new data visualisations for the mPulse web performance measurement solution.

When I'm away from my keyboard I ride road bikes, play with a 3D printer and brew fresh black coffee.
